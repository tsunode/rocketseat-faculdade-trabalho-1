# 🏭 Industrial Quality Control System

Automated Python system for production control and quality inspection of pieces manufactured in industrial assembly line.

## 📋 Project Description

This system was developed to replace the manual piece inspection process, eliminating delays, inspection failures, and reducing operational costs. The solution automates the entire process of:

- ✅ Automatic quality evaluation
- 📦 Intelligent storage in boxes
- 📊 Consolidated report generation
- 🔍 Complete piece traceability

## 🎯 Features

### Complete Interactive Menu

1. **Register new piece** - Records and automatically evaluates each produced piece
2. **List approved/rejected pieces** - Displays all pieces with their status
3. **Remove registered piece** - Removes pieces from the system when necessary
4. **List closed boxes** - Shows all complete boxes with 10 pieces
5. **Generate final report** - Complete report with statistics and analysis

### Quality Criteria

The system automatically evaluates each piece according to the following parameters:

| Criteria | Accepted Value |
|----------|---------------|
| Weight | 95g to 105g |
| Color | Blue or Green |
| Length | 10cm to 20cm |

### Storage System

- **Capacity per box:** 10 approved pieces
- **Automatic closing:** When maximum capacity is reached
- **New box:** Created automatically after closing
- **Traceability:** Each box has unique number and timestamp

## 📝 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Registering an Approved Piece

```
Choose an option: 1

Piece ID: P0001
Weight (g): 100
Color (blue/green): blue
Length (cm): 15

✓ PIECE APPROVED!
Piece P0001 registered successfully!
```

### Example 2: Registering a Rejected Piece

```
Choose an option: 1

Piece ID: P0002
Weight (g): 110
Color (blue/green): red
Length (cm): 25

✗ PIECE REJECTED!

Rejection reasons:
  • Weight out of range (110g - expected: 95g-105g)
  • Invalid color (red - expected: blue or green)
  • Length out of range (25cm - expected: 10cm-20cm)
```

### Example 3: Automatic Box Closing

```
✓ PIECE APPROVED!

📦 Box #1 CLOSED (maximum capacity reached)
📦 New box #2 started

Piece P0010 registered successfully!
```

### Example 4: Final Report

```
FINAL PRODUCTION AND QUALITY REPORT
Date/Time: 14/10/2025 10:30:45
